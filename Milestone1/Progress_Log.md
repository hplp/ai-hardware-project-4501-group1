**Step 1: Set up hardware** \\
We connected the Arduino to our computer and installed all necessary software. We cloned the project into our EdgeImpulse repository and were able to connect to our board. We were then able to upload data to our Arduino for use in training the model. A screenshot of our custom keyword ("Hey_Jarvis") training using our own different voices is included as "audioSplit.png" in this folder.
