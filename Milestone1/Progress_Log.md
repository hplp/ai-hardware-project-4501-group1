**Step 1: Set up hardware** \
We connected the Arduino to our computer and installed all necessary software. We cloned the project into our EdgeImpulse repository and were able to connect to our board. We were then able to upload data to our Arduino for use in training the model. A screenshot of our custom keyword ("Hey_Jarvis") training using our own different voices is included as "audioSplit.png" in this folder. \
 \

We've gathered abundant audio files for our trigger words 'Hey Jarvis', our command words 'turn on the lights' and 'turn off the lights', and background/unknown noise to use to train our model.
 
**Step 2: Identify/Train the model** \
TBD
