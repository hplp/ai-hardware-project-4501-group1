## Project Title:
** Hey Jarvis, Turn the Lights On**

## Project Description:

***Voice-Controlled LED Toggle with Edge Impulse***

This project demonstrates how to use the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense with Edge Impulse to toggle an LED in response to the keyword "Hey Jarvis." The goal is to showcase the integration of machine learning and embedded systems. It provides accessible use of lights for those with disabilities.

The system features voice recognition and LEDs.
It recognizes voice commands and executes them to control a lighting system with the execution of each command.

## Key Objectives:
- Recognize specific voice commands in multiple languages
- Provide appropriate audio feedback upon the execution of each command
- Map color-coded LEDs to commands and control their lighting according to those commands

## Technology Stack:
Hardware platform: Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense  
Software tools: Edge Impulse Studio, Arduino IDE  
Languages: C, Python, TinyML  

## Expected Outcomes:
We expect to deliver a working prototype consisting of our hardware platform connected to LEDs and a speaker (likely on a breadboard)
that satisfies all listed key objectives. We expect to be able to demonstrate that our project reaches our goals.

## Timeline:
November 4 - November 7 === Create and present our project introduction/proposal  
November 8 - November 15 === Receive hardware, download software, and gather audio files to train the model  
Novemeber 18 - Novemeber 22 === Train the model, start initial testing  
November 25 - November 27 === Week of Thanksgiving, dedicated to debugging and fixes  
December 2 - December 5 === Finalize prototype, create and give presentation/demo on our project
