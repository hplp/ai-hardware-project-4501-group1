## Project Title:
Jarvis, Turn the Lights On

## Project Description:
This project provides accessible use of lights for those with disabilities. 
It features multi-language voice recognition, audio feedback mechanisms, and color-coded LEDs.
It will recognize various commands and execute them to control a lighting system, providing audio feedback
to the user with the execution of each command.

## Key Objectives:
- Recognize specific voice commands in multiple languages
- Provide appropriate audio feedback upon the execution of each command
- Map color-coded LEDs to commands and control their lighting according to those commands

## Technology Stack:
(List the hardware platform, software tools, language(s), etc. you plan to use)
Hardware platform: Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
Software tools: Edge Impulse Studio, Arduino IDE
Languages: C, Python, TinyML

## Expected Outcomes:
We expect to deliver a working prototype consisting of our hardware platform connected to LEDs and a speaker (likely on a breadboard)
that satisfies all listed key objectives. We expect to be able to demonstrate that our project reaches our goals.

## Timeline:
(Provide a rough timeline or milestones for the project)
November 4 - November 7 === Create and present our project introduction/proposal
November 8 - November 15 === Receive hardware, download software, and gather audio files to train the model
Novemeber 18 - Novemeber 22 ===
